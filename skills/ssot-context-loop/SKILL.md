description: "When the user wants a governed, persistent product marketing source of truth, to set up an SSOT, scan field signals for drift, audit AI output, or manage approval gates for positioning changes. Use commands such as /setup, /scan, /confirm, /propose, /approve, /stale, /state, /brief, /manifest, and /audit-output. For lightweight bootstrap context, see product-marketing-context. This skill governs ongoing PMM knowledge and requires human approval for core changes."

# SSOT Context Loop

Maintain a governed PMM knowledge system for one client or project. It separates
approved strategy from living field intelligence, detects drift, records decisions,
and never changes canonical strategy without human approval.

## When to Use

Use this skill to create or maintain `ssot/<client-slug>/`, scan new field or market
inputs, review drift, audit generated assets, or manage canon decisions. Load
`references/ssot-spec.md` before acting. It is the detailed operational
specification for the file schemas, commands, signal model, gates, and templates.

## Relationship to Other Skills

- `product-marketing-context` is the lightweight bootstrap at
  `.agents/product-marketing-context.md`. It remains separate. If no SSOT exists,
  it may serve as context. If an SSOT exists for the active client or project, the
  SSOT is more authoritative for claims it covers.
- Never automatically overwrite `.agents/product-marketing-context.md`.
- `positioning-strategy` may develop strategy, but canon changes enter this SSOT
  only through its evidence and approval gates.
- `messaging-framework` should source differentiators from core and persona
  messaging from SSOT persona research. Do not create either standalone.
- `buyer-personas` and `customer-research` can inform persona and living evidence
  files. `competitor-profiling` can inform competitive and market evidence.
- `sales-enablement`, `copywriting`, `launch-strategy`, `market-launch`, and
  `launch-readiness-check` can read mapped SSOT files to keep assets aligned.
- `events` can adapt approved messages for event context and routes material
  narrative conflicts through this SSOT's evidence and human-approval gates.
- `output-quality-check` checks a skill's artifact against that skill's declared
  requirements. It does not audit canon consistency or change this SSOT.
- Use repo-level `manifest.yaml` in the user's project to map skills or agents to
  the SSOT files they read. Start with `/manifest` to create or update it.
- The SSOT is upstream context. Other skills do not call this skill to decide
  canon, and this skill does not depend on their outputs as authority by default.

## Operating Rules

- Separate facts, which are recorded events, from opinions, which are strategy.
  Document opinions and ground them in facts.
- Never invent a claim. Cite the quote or data, speaker and role, account type,
  system, date, and outcome or cost when known.
- Every content line in every canonical SSOT file must end with exactly one
  evidence tag: `[C]`, `[A]`, or `[G]`. `[C]` is cited, `[A]` is assumed, and `[G]`
  is a gap. Missing facts do not stop work. Keep segments with weak evidence and
  mark gaps with the evidence needed to close them.
- Strategy belongs only in core. Positioning uses differentiators already in core.
  Persona messaging uses persona research already in the SSOT.
- Keep exactly one question in each SSOT file. When an answer changes, change one
  file only. Record uncertain file placement in `09-iteration.md`.
- Field signals inform the canon, but do not automatically change it. Every
  finding gets one proposed verdict and waits at the required human gate.
- Never write to core without Gate 2 approval. Never edit or delete `comms/` input.
  Deprecate a section in place and name its replacement instead of deleting it.
- Follow the reference's file schema, staleness thresholds, taxonomy, and command
  outputs. `state.md` is written only by the reconciler, never by hand.
- Output without em dashes. Keep sentences to two lines at most. Lead bullets with
  outcomes and remove filler.

## Command Routing

Route explicit commands to the matching workflow in `references/ssot-spec.md`:

- `/setup <client>` creates the baseline SSOT from supplied source documents.
- `/scan <client>` archives new inputs, classifies signals, and reports drift.
- `/confirm <IDs>` and `/reject <ID> <reason>` perform Gate 1 decisions.
- `/propose` prepares confirmed changes and impact analysis for Gate 2.
- `/approve <IDs>` and `/revise <ID> <notes>` handle Gate 2 decisions.
- `/stale`, `/state`, `/brief`, `/manifest`, and `/audit-output` produce their
  specified reports or project files.

If the user provides no command, ask which client and files are in scope, then list
the available commands. Do not infer approval from silence or proceed past a gate.

## Output Behavior

Write or propose files in the user's working project, never inside this skill or
the PMM-Skills repository. Keep raw uploaded material in the project's immutable
`ssot/<client-slug>/comms/` directory. Respect the workflow's stop points.

After each workflow-authorized file creation or change, commit and push the
generated SSOT output to the project's GitHub-backed repository. GitHub is the
durable source of truth, not the chat. Preserve the required stop points: `/scan`
stops at Gate 1, and proposed changes wait at Gate 2. Never modify core or commit
a core change before explicit human approval at Gate 2.

For Gate 2 approval, return each ready-to-commit file in full, one code block per
file with its path as the heading. Include the decision record for every core
change, regenerated `state.md`, and a commit message. Commit and push the approved
files after approval.

For `/scan`, return the drift report, three one-line priority findings, and
"Needs your call" questions, then stop at Gate 1. For `/brief`, keep the team
summary to ten lines or fewer and omit internal gate details.
